# Bypassing Google Family Link Using Microsoft SwiftKey

> How some users exploit Microsoft SwiftKey keyboard to bypass Family Link restrictions and why this happens.

## üì± What is Microsoft SwiftKey?

Microsoft SwiftKey is a virtual keyboard for mobile phones that replaces the default keyboard. It is popular because it uses artificial intelligence to predict words and automatically correct text, making typing faster and more accurate. It also includes a feature called **Copilot AI**, which allows users to perform web searches directly from the keyboard without opening a separate browser.

## üß† Method Description

Microsoft SwiftKey includes a feature called **Copilot AI** that lets users perform web searches directly from the keyboard, without needing to open a browser like Chrome. Some teenagers have discovered how to use this feature as a "backdoor" to access the internet when other apps are blocked by Google Family Link.

### ü™ú Typical steps of the method:

1. **Ask parents to install Microsoft SwiftKey**, claiming it improves vocabulary, is more comfortable, and better than Gboard.
2. Open SwiftKey and **set it as the default keyboard**.
3. Open an allowed app (for example, WhatsApp or email).
4. Start a conversation with yourself (self-message).
5. Click on the **Copilot AI icon**.
6. Use the built-in search function to **search on Google or Bing** or directly access websites from the keyboard.
7. From there, they can even **log in to blocked sites** or access content outside the allowed screen time.

## üõ°Ô∏è How to prevent it

* **Do not install keyboards with internet access** (like SwiftKey or similars) if the child is under technical supervision.
* If already installed, **block the app using Family Link parental controls**, if your system allows it.
* Set **Gboard** as the default keyboard.
* **Block installation of apps from unknown sources** via Family Link.

## üéØ Reflection

These kinds of bypasses show a need for more dialogue. If a teenager feels the need to find shortcuts, it may indicate they don‚Äôt understand (or accept) the restrictions imposed. Opening communication channels can be more effective in the long run than simply reinforcing limits.

## üß™ Detection

It‚Äôs not always obvious when SwiftKey is being used this way. Some signs include:

* SwiftKey is active as the keyboard, even though parents never authorized it.
* Copilot search history includes terms that would normally be searched in a browser.
* The child spends more time than usual on their phone.

## ‚úÖ Exploit Status

**Works on most devices (2025)**
There is no official fix preventing this behavior from the SwiftKey app or Family Link.
