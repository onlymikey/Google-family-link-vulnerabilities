> A resource for parents, guardians, and curious teens alike — exploring how Google Family Link can be bypassed, why it happens, and how to respond with empathy and understanding.

## 🧩 Introduction

Welcome! If you've found this repository, you're probably trying to understand how Google Family Link works — and sometimes doesn't work as intended.

This project was born from real-life experience between siblings. It documents methods used to bypass restrictions set by Family Link, not to promote rebellion or strict control, but to help both sides understand what’s really happening under the hood.

- If you're a **parent**, this repo might help you protect your children more effectively and fairly.
- If you're a **kid or teen**, this repo might help you understand why your device has limits and how to talk about them.

Technology isn't the enemy. Silence and mistrust are.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository **does not encourage bypassing supervision**. It aims to:

- Support responsible parents in detecting and preventing evasions.
- Help teens who feel overrestricted understand what's happening.
- Encourage honest conversations over hidden battles.
- Document and study Family Link from a technical and social perspective.

> Please use this information ethically and legally. Always prioritize respect, privacy, and mutual trust.

## 📘 Understanding Google Family Link

Google Family Link is a parental control tool used to:

- Set app usage limits.
- Define screen time and bedtime schedules.
- Approve or block app installations.
- Monitor general activity.

But like any system, it has weaknesses. Children who feel too restricted often find creative (and sometimes concerning) ways to regain control of their devices.

Understanding these workarounds helps us ask better questions:
- Why are they trying to bypass the controls?
- What conversations haven't happened yet?
- Is this about control, or communication?

This project explores both the **technical exploits** and the **human dynamics** behind them.
